# Threats targeting the hybrid & cloud identity platform

## Overview

Contoso is a big name and cannot risk being on the front page of all newspapers because of those stupid ransomware attacks that could have been easily prevented.
Thus, they have decided to create a strong security team. They hired two new employees <font style="color:red;">**Miss Red**</font> and <font style="color:blue;">**Mister Blue**</font> to respectively take care of the Red and Blue team.
The objective for Miss Red will be to test and detect vulnerable configuration and uncover unsecure practices. The objective for Mr Blue will be to implement proper monitoring and defense mitigations against the attacks detected by the red team.

A group of people authorized and organized to emulate a potential adversary‚Äôs attack or exploitation capabilities against an enterprise‚Äôs security posture. The <font style="color:red;">**Red Team**</font>‚Äôs objective is to improve enterprise Information Assurance by demonstrating the impacts of successful attacks and by demonstrating what works for the defenders (i.e., the Blue Team) in an operational environment. The group responsible for defending an enterprise‚Äôs use of information systems by maintaining its security posture against a group of mock attackers (i.e., the Red Team). Typically, the <font style="color:blue;">**Blue Team**</font> and its supporters must defend against real or simulated attacks [‚Ä¶]

# Reconnaissance 
All exercises and tasks must be done in the defined order. They build on each other, if you skip a step, you will no longer be able to continue.

In this lab, your role will alternate between a member of the <font style="color:red;">**Red Team**</font> and a member of the <font style="color:blue;">**Blue Team**</font>. This way you will be able to see what an attacker sees as well as how to configure the environment to mitigate the attacks. This lab will focus on the reconnaissance operations that an attacker can perform to gather intel about the environment. 

You mainly use two accounts:

|Red Team|Blue Team|
|:--------:|:--------:|
|Miss Red|Mister Blue|
|CONTOSO\red|CONTOSO\blue|

<font style="color:red;">**CONTOSO\red**</font> is only a user of **CONTOSO\Domain Users** and does not have any privilege on the domain. However, she is a member of the local **Administrators** group on **CLI01**.

<font style="color:blue;">**CONTOSO\blue**</font> is a domain privileged account member of the **Domain Admins** group.

===

## Exercise 1 - Prepare the environment
You will probably find the environment familiar as it is the continuity of the previous labs. We have the following machines:
- **DC01** a domain controller for contoso.com running Windows Server 2016 in the HQ Active Directory site
- **DC02** a domain controller for contoso.com running Windows Server 2022 in the Beijin Active Directory site
- **SRV01** a domain joined server member of the contoso.com domain running Windows Server 2022
- **CLI01** a domain joined client member of the contoso.com domain running Windows 11

### Task 1 - Create some activities on SRV01
1. [] Log on to **@lab.VirtualMachine(SRV01).SelectLink**. 
Use the following credentials:
    |||
    |:--------|:--------|
    | Username | `CONTOSO\lee.mendoza.adm` |
    | Password | `NeverTrustAny1!` |
    

1. [] Right click on the Start menu !IMAGE[2022menu.png](2022menu.png) and click on **Run**.
1. [] In the **Run** window, type `\\DC01\SYSVOL` and click **OK**.

    üìù What types of files can we find in this folder?

This will open an explorer window and will maintain an SMB connection between SRV01 and DC01. Leave it open like this and carry on. 

### Task 2 - Create some activities from DC02
1. [] Log on to **@lab.VirtualMachine(DC02).SelectLink**. 
Use the following credentials:
    |||
    |:--------|:--------|
    | Username | `CONTOSO\v.fergusson.adm` |
    | Password | `NeverTrustAny1!` |
    

1. [] Right click on the Start menu !IMAGE[2022menu.png](2022menu.png) and click on **Run**.
1. [] In the **Run** window, type `\\DC01\C$` and click **OK**.

This will open an explorer window and will maintain an SMB connection between DC02 and SRV01. Leave it open like this and carry on.

## Exercise 2 - Use BloodHound for recon

Hello <font style="color:red;">**Miss Red**</font>! In this exercise you will use BloodHound and its collection script SharpHound to enumerate objects in Active Directory. Note that although BloodHound could be use for Azure AD recon, we will focus only on on-premises Active Directory in this exercise. 

### Task 1 - Run SharpHound

1. [] Log on to **@lab.VirtualMachine(CLI01).SelectLink**. Use the following credentials:
    |||
    |:--------|:--------|
    | Username | `CONTOSO\red` |
    | Password | `NeverTrustAny1!` |
    

1. [] Right click on the Start menu !IMAGE[11menu.png](11menu.png) and click on **Windows Terminal (Admin)**.

1. [] Change the current directory by typing `cd \Tools\Scripts` and hit **Enter**.

    >[!knowledge] **cd** is the DOS command to change directory, in PowerShell, **cd** is an alias for the **Set-Location** commandLet. You can type `Get-Alias cd` to confirm it.

    üìù ls is an alias for what PowerShell command?

1. [] Display the help menu for **SharpHound** by typing `.\sharphound.exe --?` and hit **Enter**.
    
    >[!knowledge] Get familiar with the available options. Specifically the **--collectionmethods**. Each of this collection method will bring a particular type of information. Not all methods are relevant depending of the type of recon you want to perfom. We'll get to that later.

1. [] Run **SharpHound** by executing `.\sharphound.exe --collectionmethods All --skippasswordcheck`

    THe collection will take a minute or two.
   
    >[!knowledge] The collection should take a minute or so as there are not a lot of objects in your environment. In a production environment, this can take hours and should be optimized for performance and stealth. 

1. [] Now we also want to enumerate as many **SRV01**. We are going to create a file that will contain our long list of computer to scan... Well, just one. Execute the following `Write-Output "SRV01.contoso.com" | Out-File computers.lst`

1. [] Run **SharpHound** again but this time by executing `.\sharphound.exe --collectionmethods All --computerfile computers.lst --skippasswordcheck`

1. [] You can see the collection files you have created by running the following command `dir *.zip`. 

    üìù How many zip files do you see?

### Task 2 - Run BloodHound

1. [] You are still connected to **@lab.VirtualMachine(CLI01).SelectLink**. Open the **File Explorer** and navigate to `C:\Tools\BloodHound`. Then double click on the **BloodHound.exe** icon.

1. [] You should see the BloodHound login prompt with the default bolt path `bolt://localhost:7687`. Use the following credentials:
    |||
    |:--------|:--------|
    | Neo4j Username | `neo4j` |
    | Neo4j Password | `NeverTrustAny1!` |

1. [] You are welcomed with a message telling you there's nothing in the database. Well, let's change that and import the zip files you have created. Click on the **Upload Data** button on the right side !IMAGE[BH1.png](BH1.png). Navigate to the `C:\Tools\Script` folder, select the first zip file and click **Open**. The import should take a few seconds. 

1. [] Click on the **Upload Data** button again and select the second zip file and click **Open**. Then click the small white X next to the popup title **Upload Progress**.

1. [] Click the burger menu on the top left corner !IMAGE[BH2.png](BH2.png) then click on the **Analysis** tab. Scroll down to the **Shortest Paths** section and click **Find Shortest Path do Domain Admins**. In the popup, click on **DOMAIN ADMIN@CONTOSO.COM**.

    You should see something like this:

    !IMAGE[BH3.png](BH3.png)

    Spend some time exploring the graph. Note the different types of edges. Some of them were obtained by performing LDAP queries:
    - MemberOf
    - Contains
    - GenericAll
    - GPLink
    - ...
    
    Some others by SMB enumerations against the DCs
    - HasSession

    üìù Can you see who has a session and from where?

1. [] On the **Search for a node** on the top left corner, type `SRV01.CONTOSO.COM`. You should see a machine icon in the center of the window. Right click on it and select **Shortest Paths to Here**.

    You should see something like this:

    !IMAGE[BH4.png](BH4.png)
    
    This time you can see another type of edge collected by a SAM-R enumeration:
    - CanRDP

    <details><summary>‚ùì Can you guess what it means? **Click here to see the answer**.</summary>
    In this case, it means that the user Abigail Storey is a member of the local group **Remote Desktop Users** on **SRV01**. 
    </details> 

Good job <font style="color:red;">**Miss Red**</font>! 
You are now sharing your findings with <font style="color:blue;">**Mister Blue**</font>.

===

## Exercise 3 - Enumerate domain users and group anonymously 
Hello <font style="color:red;">**Miss Red**</font>! Your collegue and almost nemessis by now <font style="color:blue;">**Mister Blue**</font> is hardening the environment based on your input. Let's show him that you can do even better )or worse) than BloodHound and let's gather intel without using an account.

### Task 1 - Use anonymous SAM-R enumeration

1. [] Log on to **@lab.VirtualMachine(CLI01).SelectLink**. Use the following credentials:
    |||
    |:--------|:--------|
    | Username | `CONTOSO\red` |
    | Password | `NeverTrustAny1!` |
    
1. [] If you don't have a **Windows Terminal** already opened, open a new one by right clicking on the Start menu !IMAGE[11menu.png](11menu.png) and clicking on **Windows Terminal (Admin)**. Else you can use an existing one.

1. [] In the terminal, open a new tab by clicking on the chevron and selecting **Command Prompt** like shown in this screenshot:  !IMAGE[TERM1.png](TERM1.png)

1. [] In this new tab, run the following command `nmap --script smb-enum-users -p 445 DC01`. This is essentially doing a SAM-R call and as you can see, we did not specify a user.

    >[!knowledge] You can run the same command with `-d` to use the debug mode and see in the ouput that we did not authenticate.

You send the output to <font style="color:blue;">**Mister Blue**</font> with a nice encouragement message "Do better".

### Task 2 - Block anonymous SAM-R enumeration

1. [] Log on to **@lab.VirtualMachine(DC01).SelectLink**. Use the following credentials:
    |||
    |:--------|:--------|
    | Username | `CONTOSO\blue` |
    | Password | `NeverTrustAny1!` |

1. [] Right click on the Start menu !IMAGE[2022menu.png](2022menu.png) and click on **Run**.

1. [] In the **Run** window, type `dsa.msc` and click **OK**.

1. [] In the **Active Directory Users and Computers** window, navigate to **contoso.com** > **Builtin** and double click on the group **Pre-Windows 2000 Compatible Access**. Select the **Members** tab.

    >[!knowledge] The presence of the security principal **ANONYMOUS LOGON** is the reason why Red's SAM-R enumeration worked without authentication.

   üìù Who else is a member of this group in the lab?

1. [] Select **ANONYMOUS LOGON**, click **Remove** and **OK**. If there is a confirmation popup, confirm by clicking **Yes**. 

1. [] Right click on the Start menu !IMAGE[2022menu.png](2022menu.png) and click on **Run**.

1. [] In the **Run** window, type `services.msc` and click **OK**.

1. [] In the **Services** console, right click on the **Server** service and click **Restart**. A pop-up will ask you if you want to restart the dependencies, click **Yes**.

### Task 3 - Check that anonymous SAM-R enumeration is disabled

1. [] Go back to **@lab.VirtualMachine(CLI01).SelectLink** using the following credentials:
    |||
    |:--------|:--------|
    | Username | `CONTOSO\red` |
    | Password | `NeverTrustAny1!` |
    
1. [] In the command prompt tab, run the following command `nmap --script smb-enum-users -p 445 DC01 -d`. 

    üìù What is the error message?

===

Good job to you two <font style="color:red;">**Miss Red**</font> and <font style="color:blue;">**Mister Blue**</font>. Your efforts allowed Contoso's environment to be more resistant to reconnaissance actions.

Remember that in an assumed breach world, you need to attack the economic model of the malicious actors! Making recon noisy and slow it definitely going to help!

üçæ Congratulations! You have completed the labs for this chapter.

**Make sure you have noted all the answers to the questions marked with üìù.**
